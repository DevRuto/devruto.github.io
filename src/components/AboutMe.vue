      About Me

      <p>
        Hey! My name is Winston. I'm a recent graduate from Rochester Institute of Techology,
        with a Bachelor in Web and Mobile Computing!
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy learning new technologies. I started programming in C# when I was in high school,
        developing console and WinForms/WPF applications, and now I primarily develop WebAPIs in C#.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I've developed several websites using SPA frameworks, React, and VueJS.
        React was the first framework I learned, and it was really fun to work with, a lot better than writing a website
        in plain HTML/CSS/JS. Now, I mainly use VueJS for all my web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am spending my time learning about Cloud technologies, namely AWS.
